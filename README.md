## Overview

CureAI aims to provide users with an intelligent platform for discussing health concerns. Patients can interact with an AI chatbot for initial guidance, get potential diagnostic insights (which are explicitly not a substitute for professional medical advice), and connect with registered doctors for consultations via chat and video calls. Doctors can manage their profiles, availability, and appointments.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
* Flutter SDK (latest stable version recommended)
* Dart SDK (comes with Flutter)
* Python (3.8+ recommended)
* `pip` (Python package installer)
* Firebase Account and Project
* Groq API Key
* Ngrok Account and CLI installed

### Firebase Setup
1.  **Create a Firebase Project:** Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project (e.g., `cureai-7da2f` if you haven't already).
2.  **Register Your Flutter App:**
    * Add an Android app and/or an iOS app to your Firebase project. Follow the instructions to download `google-services.json` (for Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) and place them in the correct directories in your Flutter project.
    * Ensure `firebase_options.dart` is correctly generated and present in your Flutter project (`flutterfire configure` can help).
3.  **Enable Firebase Services:**
    * **Authentication:** Enable Email/Password sign-in.
    * **Firestore Database:** Create a Firestore database. Start in **test mode** for initial development (but secure it with proper rules before production).
    * **Storage:** Enable Firebase Storage for profile images.
4.  **Service Account Key for Backend:**
    * In your Firebase project settings, go to "Service accounts."
    * Generate a new private key and download the JSON file. This will be used by the Python backend.
5.  **Firestore Security Rules:**
    * Update your Firestore security rules. Refer to the [Security Rules section](#security-rules) (or add a dedicated section if needed) for examples covering `users`, `doctors`, `patients`, `appointments`, `chat_rooms`, `calls`, and `aiChatSessions`. *(You'll need to paste the final version of your rules here or link to them)*.

### Backend Setup (FastAPI)

1.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable) or navigate to your `FAST_API` directory.**
2.  **Place Service Account Key:**
    * Create a directory named `cred` inside your `FAST_API` project root.
    * Place the downloaded Firebase service account JSON file (e.g., `your-project-id-firebase-adminsdk.json`) into the `cred/` directory.
3.  **Create a `.env` file** in the `FAST_API` project root with the following content (replace placeholders):
    ```env
    FIREBASE_CREDENTIAL_PATH="cred/your-project-id-firebase-adminsdk.json"
    GROQ_API_KEY="your_actual_groq_api_key"
    LLM_MODEL_NAME="llama3-70b-8192" # Or your preferred Groq model
    ENVIRONMENT="development" 
    # API_KEYS="your_general_api_key_if_needed" 
    # ALLOWED_ORIGINS="*" # For development; restrict in production
    ```
    **Note:** Ensure `your-project-id-firebase-adminsdk.json` matches the name of your service account file.
4.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # Activate it:
    # Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
5.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (Ensure `requirements.txt` includes `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `firebase-admin`, `groq`, `python-dotenv`, `pydantic`, etc.)

### Flutter Frontend Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable) or navigate to your Flutter project directory.**
2.  **Ensure Firebase is Configured:**
    * `google-services.json` should be in `android/app/`.
    * `GoogleService-Info.plist` should be in `ios/Runner/`.
    * `lib/firebase_options.dart` should be present and correct for your Firebase project.
3.  **Get Flutter Packages:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

## Running the Application

To use all features, especially the AI Chatbot, both the backend server and the Flutter app need to be running. Ngrok is used to expose your local backend to the internet so the Flutter app (especially on a physical device) can reach it.

### 1. Start the Backend Server

1.  Open a terminal in your `FAST_API` project directory.
2.  Activate your Python virtual environment (e.g., `venv\Scripts\activate` or `source venv/bin/activate`).
3.  Run the FastAPI application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    Or, if you prefer to specify the host and port for Uvicorn directly (matching the default in `app.py` for development):
    ```bash
    python -m uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
    ```
    The server should start, typically on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Note this address and port.

### 2. Expose Backend with Ngrok (for AI Chatbot)

1.  **Download Ngrok:** If you haven't already, download ngrok from [https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup/windows](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup/windows) (or the appropriate link for your OS).
2.  **Authenticate Ngrok (One-time setup):** Follow the instructions on the ngrok website to add your authtoken.
3.  **Run Ngrok:** Open a new terminal and run the following command, replacing `8000` if your FastAPI server is running on a different port:
    ```bash
    ngrok http 127.0.0.1:8000
    ```
    (If your FastAPI app runs on `0.0.0.0:8000`, `ngrok http 8000` is also fine).
4.  **Copy Ngrok URL:** Ngrok will provide a "Forwarding" URL that looks something like `https://<random-string>.ngrok-free.app`. Copy this HTTPS URL.

### 3. Configure Flutter App with Ngrok URL

1.  Open your Flutter project.
2.  Navigate to `lib/screens/ai_chatbot_screen.dart`.
3.  Find the `_apiBaseUrl` variable within the `AIChatService` class (or wherever you've defined it).
4.  Paste the HTTPS URL you copied from ngrok, ensuring it points to your API's base path:
    ```dart
    // In lib/screens/ai_chatbot_screen.dart (inside AIChatService)
    final String _apiBaseUrl = "YOUR_NGROK_HTTPS_URL_HERE/api/v1"; 
    // Example: final String _apiBaseUrl = "[https://5eae-2400-adc1-40d-2f00-5859-b363-cc6b-5441.ngrok-free.app/api/v1](https://5eae-2400-adc1-40d-2f00-5859-b363-cc6b-5441.ngrok-free.app/api/v1)";
    ```

### 4. Run the Flutter Application

1.  Open your Flutter project in your IDE (VS Code, Android Studio).
2.  Select your target device (emulator or physical device).
3.  Run the Flutter app:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
4.  You should now be able to sign up, log in, and use the AI Chatbot feature, which will communicate with your local backend via ngrok.

## API Endpoints Overview

The backend exposes the following main endpoints under the `/api/v1` prefix:

* `GET /health`: Checks the health of the API and its dependent services.
* `POST /session/start`: Initializes or resets a patient's chat session, potentially with medical history.
* `POST /session/reset`: Resets a patient's conversation context on the backend.
* `POST /message`: Sends a patient's message to the AI and receives a response, potentially including a diagnosis.
* `GET /conversation/{patient_id}`: Retrieves conversation history for a patient.
* `GET /diagnoses/{patient_id}`: Retrieves all stored diagnoses for a patient.
* `GET /latest-diagnosis/{patient_id}`: Retrieves the most recent diagnosis for a patient.
